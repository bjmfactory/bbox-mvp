# Brevity Box

## Link sharing for people who don't have much to say
You can save 3 links here. That's it.

## Summary
Brevity Box is a place where you can link to your current 3 favorite places on the Internet.
You may be saying to yourself, "3 is way too many." To that we would say, "You can use
only 1 if you want."

## Problem: There are too many links.
Have you noticed that there are quite a few links out there? It's overwhelming.

## Solution
On Brevity Box everyone gets 3 links. You can link wherever you want, and you can change
them whenever you want, but you only get 3. That way you don't have to look through
all the links, just 3 for each person.
