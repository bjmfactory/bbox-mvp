# Brevity Box

## A network for people who don't have much to say
You can share your favorite 3 links here. And you can look at 3 links that other people
have saved.

## Summary
Brevity Box is a place where you can link to your current 3 favorite places on the
Internet. You may be saying to yourself, "3 is way too many." To that we would say,
"You don't have to use all 3."

## Problem: There are too many links.
Have you noticed that there are quite a few links out there? It's overwhelming.

## Solution
On Brevity Box everyone gets 3 links. You can link wherever you want, and you can change
them whenever you want, but you only get 3. That way you don't have to look through
all the links, just 3 for each person.
